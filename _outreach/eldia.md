op-ed about the sexism that women suffer in the scientific environment, with a particular focus on the astrophysical community.


This forthcoming op-ed, “La astrofísica, el sexismo y el miedo a alzar la voz” (2025,
in press), addresses an urgent issue within the scientific community: the persistence
of sexism and the barriers it creates for women in astrophysics. While not a
traditional research article, its significance lies in its engagement with the structural
and cultural challenges that shape the scientific environment, directly impacting who
can participate, progress, and lead in our field. By combining personal perspective,
testimonies from colleagues, and broader reflections, the piece contributes to the
growing body of literature on gender equality in science, but with a rare focus on the
astrophysical community.
The central argument of the op-ed is that sexism in astrophysics is not only
expressed through discrimination, but also through subtle, systemic behaviours that
create an atmosphere of silence and fear among women. This silence perpetuates
inequality and erodes diversity, limiting the scope of perspectives in research and
ultimately constraining scientific progress. The article situates these issues within the
broader context of international debates on equity, diversity, and inclusion, while
grounding them in specific examples from astrophysics.
The significance of this publication lies in its potential impact beyond academia. By
raising awareness and fostering open discussion, it aims to contribute to cultural
change within astrophysics, support women and underrepresented groups, and
promote a more inclusive and equitable scientific community.
