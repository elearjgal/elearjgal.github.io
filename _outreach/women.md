IAC initiative that aims to make the work of women in Astronomy-Astrophysics visible, while offering girls inspiring role models to promote their scientific and technological vocations. It consists of videoconferences or in-person talks with educational centres by women astrophysicists and engineers who work at the IAC and at other institutions present in the Observatories of the Canary Islands, in which they explain their work, talk about their field of research and answer students' questions about the scientific and technological careers, the Universe or the methods we use to get to know it better.

I participated in this initiative twice. As part of this program, I was asked to give a seminar at my former secondary school in 2023 and 2024.


- 2024, In-person talk at the Instituto de Educación Secundaria de Herrera (Seville), where I talked about the role of women in astrophysics, and the shape of the galaxies, how they form and evolve over the time of the universe.

- 2023, In-person talk at the Instituto de Educación Secundaria de Herrera (Seville), where I talked about the role of women in astrophysics, my scientific career and other curiosities about my research life for senior high-school students.
