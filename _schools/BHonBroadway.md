In this talk, I presented the main results of what would later become Arjona-Gálvez et
al. (2024), discussing the impact of active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback on the
evolution of dwarf galaxies using a modify suite of the AURIGA cosmological
simulations. The presentation explored how supermassive black holes influence gas
accretion and star formation in low-mass systems, offering new theoretical
predictions that can be tested both theorethically and observationally.
The Black Holes on Broadway workshop brought together leading experts in AGN
and galaxy formation simulations, providing an exceptional opportunity to share my
findings within a highly specialised and internationally recognised community.
Presenting alongside scientists from major simulation collaborations such as
IllustrisTNG, SIMBA, FIRE and AREPO, I received valuable feedback that helped
refine the interpretation and presentation of my results prior to publication.
As the first author and primary developer of the analysis pipeline, I was responsible
for designing the methodology, conducting the statistical analysis, and synthesising
the physical interpretation. The discussion following the presentation helped identify
potential extensions to the project, particularly regarding the inclusion of dynamical
friction effects and the observational constraints on black hole growth in dwarfs that
directly influences this fellowship proposal.
Participating in this workshop was a key step in consolidating my international
research profile. It allowed me to present my work to a distinguished audience,
exchange ideas with leaders in the field, and strengthen professional ties that have
informed both my current and future research directions in black hole physics and
galaxy evolution.
