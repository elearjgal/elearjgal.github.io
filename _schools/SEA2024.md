This talk presented the key results of Arjona-Gálvez et al. (2024), which investigates
how active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback influences the evolution of dwarf
galaxies using the AURIGA cosmological simulations. The study provides evidence
that feedback from supermassive black holes can suppress star formation in low-
mass galaxies, offering new insights into the physical processes that regulate their
growth.
Presenting these findings at the SEA meeting—the largest astronomy conference in
Spain—was an important step in sharing my research with a broad audience of both
theoretical and observational astrophysicists. The talk generated discussion on the
detectability of AGN signatures in dwarf galaxies and the implications for upcoming
surveys such as LSST and Euclid.
As the first author and lead analyst, I was responsible for the design,
implementation, and interpretation of the simulation analysis. This presentation
allowed me to strengthen connections within the Spanish astrophysics community,
receive constructive feedback, and showcase the impact of my work on
understanding black hole–galaxy coevolution in the low-mass regime, leading to new
collaborations inside the astronomical Spanish community.
