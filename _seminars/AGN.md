I was invited to the AGN Talk Series at IAC to present my results on AGN feedback
in dwarf galaxies, linking simulation predictions with observations of low-luminosity
AGN. This platform allowed me to engage with specialists in AGN physics and
demonstrate how cosmological simulations can provide constraints on feedback
efficiencies. The seminar strengthened collaborative links with the IAC AGN group
and showcased the interdisciplinary relevance of my work.
