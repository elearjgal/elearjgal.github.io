In this talk, I presented the main results of my first-author paper Arjona-Gálvez et al.
(2024), which investigates the impact of active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback on
the evolution of dwarf galaxies using a modification of the AURIGA suite of
cosmological simulations. The study provides one of the first systematic analyses of
how supermassive black holes influence the star formation histories, gas content,
and dark matter of low-mass galaxies within a fully cosmological context. My results
demonstrated that even relatively low-supermassive black holes can substantially
suppress star formation in dwarf galaxies, thereby offering new insights into the
physical mechanisms that regulate their baryonic evolution.
As the principal author, I led all aspects of this project — from simulation analysis
and data processing using Pynbody and Python-based pipelines, to the
interpretation of the physical trends and the manuscript preparation. The work
bridges the gap between theoretical modeling and observational efforts to detect
AGN activity in dwarf galaxies, showing that feedback from supermassive black
holes may play an underestimated role in shaping their observable properties.
Presenting this research at the CLUES meeting allowed me to engage directly with
an international audience of experts in galaxy formation and the local universe. The
discussions following my talk were particularly valuable for contextualizing my
findings within broader questions of feedback efficiency and environmental
dependence.
