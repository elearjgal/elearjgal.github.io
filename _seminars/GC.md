This informal seminar was my first presentation of early PhD results on the
demographics of black holes in AURIGA dwarfs. Presenting in this format allowed
me to explain complex material to a broad audience of researchers across
astrophysical subfields, honing my skills in communicating across disciplines while
receiving diverse feedback.
