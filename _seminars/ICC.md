At the ICC I presented the results of Arjona-Gálvez et al. (2025) and outlined
planned follow-up work extending the study to satellite galaxies. Preliminary results
indicate two distinct satellite populations in the size–stellar mass plane: one
population that follows the former relation and a second population that lies
systematically above it. The latter population shows systematic trends with redshift
and with host-centric distance.
The seminar described the planned analysis to identify and characterise these two
populations using the AURIGA-Superstars simulations. This investigation will apply
the new size metric together with a newly developed, more sophisticated method for
detecting galaxy edges created by Giulia Golini. The project will be carried out in
collaboration with Giulia and Dr. Francesca Fragkoudi and aims to quantify how
satellite sizes depend on environment and cosmic time. Presenting this at the ICC
enabled in-depth discussion with experts in simulation analysis and galaxy structure.
