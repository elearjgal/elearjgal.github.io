I presented my latest simulation results at the moment at the Milky Way and Local
Group (MWLG) journal club, focusing on black holes in dwarf galaxies. This internal
but expert setting allowed me to communicate my results to peers, receive
constructive feedback, and contribute to ongoing discussions on black hole–galaxy
coevolution.
