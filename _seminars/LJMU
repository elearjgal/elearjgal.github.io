This seminar focused on the work later published as Arjona-Gálvez et al. 2024 in
Astronomy & Astrophysics. I presented my analysis of black holes in dwarf galaxies
within the AURIGA simulations, showing how active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback
regulates star formation and can even suppress it entirely in low-mass systems. The
talk emphasised the importance of MBHs in shaping the evolution of dwarf galaxies,
a result with strong implications for understanding galaxy quenching. Presenting at
LJMU, a leading centre in computational astrophysics, allowed me to receive
targeted feedback from experts in cosmological simulations and galaxy evolution,
refining the presentation of results prior to publication. This talk also helped
consolidate collaborative links with researchers at LJMU during my research stay.
