This invited seminar showcased my recent first-author contributions to the study of
super massive black holes (SMBHs) in dwarf galaxies using the AURIGA
cosmological simulations. I presented the results of Arjona-Gálvez et al. 2024, where
I demonstrated how SMBHs suppress star formation in low-mass galaxies through
AGN feedback, providing new insight into dwarf galaxy quenching. I also highlighted
Arjona-Gálvez et al. 2025, which introduced a new, physically motivated definition of
galaxy size across different simulation suites, with direct implications for measuring
BH–galaxy coevolution. Presenting these two complementary works together
underlined both my expertise in simulation analysis and my ability to lead
independent projects. Hosted at UCR, an institution with strong expertise in galaxy
evolution, the talk broadened my international profile, fostered exchanges with
observers and theorists, and established the foundation for future collaborations on
SMBH formation and growth.
