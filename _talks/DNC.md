I was invited to deliver the highlight talk representing the Galaxy Formation research
line at the annual Día de Nuestra Ciencia y Tecnología conference, an internal event
that showcases the most relevant research from the Instituto de Astrofísica de
Canarias (IAC). My presentation focused on the results from Arjona-Gálvez et al.
(2025). This work provides a consistent and robust framework for comparing
simulated galaxy properties, addressing long-standing inconsistencies in size
measurements that arise from differing definitions across simulation suites and
obseved galaxies.
In addition to presenting the methodology and key results of my own research, I also
offered an overview of the collective progress of the IAC simulation group. The talk
therefore served both as a platform to disseminate my first-author publication and as
a representation of the group’s broader contributions to galaxy evolution research.
Being selected to give the highlight talk among numerous candidates was a
recognition of the scientific relevance and impact of my work, as well as my growing
leadership role within the simulation community at the IAC. The discussion that
followed provided valuable feedback from senior researchers, which helped to shape
subsequent extensions of the project toward satellite galaxy populations and cluster
environments.
