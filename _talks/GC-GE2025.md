This invited talk presented the follow-up work to Arjona-Gálvez et al. (2024), extending the analysis of AGN feedback in dwarf galaxies to explore in greater depth the physics of gas outflows driven by supermassive black holes. Using the same suite of AURIGA cosmological simulations, I examined the kinematic and thermodynamic properties of the gas surrounding active nuclei in low-mass galaxies, identifying clear signatures of AGN-driven winds and quantifying their impact on the surrounding interstellar medium. These results provide a bridge between theoretical models and observations, offering predictive diagnostics that can be directly tested with current and upcoming integral-field spectroscopic surveys. Being invited to present at the Zooming in Galactic Centers workshop at the Lorentz Center—an international meeting dedicated to understanding the physical processes that govern the center of galaxies—offered an opportunity to discuss this new phase of my research with leading experts in AGN and galactic physic. The presentation highlighted how dwarf galaxies, though small, serve as crucial laboratories for understanding the fundamental mechanisms by which AGN regulate star formation across cosmic time. As the project’s lead investigator, I developed the analysis framework for identifying and characterizing outflowing gas components, implemented new post-processing tools for synthetic observation generation, and interpreted the results within the context of current observational campaigns. This talk not only disseminated cutting-edge findings but also initiated collaborations aimed at comparing simulation-based predictions with real datasets, strengthening the link between numerical and observational astrophysics.
